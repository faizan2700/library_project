# Gutenberg Database Clone

Welcome to the Gutenberg Database Clone project! ðŸ“š

This project aims to create a clone of the Gutenberg project by utilizing their database dump. Gutenberg, named after the famous inventor of the printing press, is a digital library offering over 60,000 free eBooks, covering a wide range of genres and subjects. By cloning their database, we aim to provide developers and enthusiasts with a locally accessible version of the Gutenberg project for experimentation, analysis, and integration into their own projects.

## Features

- **Database Clone**: Utilize the Gutenberg project's database dump to recreate a local version of their digital library.
- **Offline Access**: Access the vast collection of over 60,000 free eBooks offline for research, analysis, or reading pleasure.
- **Exploration and Analysis**: Analyze the Gutenberg dataset to gain insights into literary trends, popular genres, and authorship.
- **Integration**: Integrate the cloned Gutenberg database into your own applications, projects, or research endeavors.
- **Contributions**: Contribute to the project by enhancing the database clone, improving accessibility, or adding new features.

## Database Model

This project utilizes the Gutenberg database dump, consisting of the following tables:

- **Author**: Contains information about authors of the eBooks.
- **Language**: Stores information about the languages in which the eBooks are available.
- **Bookshelf**: Represents bookshelves containing collections of eBooks.
- **Subject**: Stores subjects or categories of eBooks.
- **Format**: Contains links and media types for each eBook.
- **Book**: Represents individual eBooks and includes Many-to-Many relationships with authors, subjects, bookshelves, and languages.

Additionally, the project utilizes the Django `User` model, which utilizes an abstract table from the Django contrib auth app.

## Getting Started

To prepare the database for use, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the following commands, This will populate all the necessary tables with data.:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py populate_db  
   ```
3. To clean the database, run: 
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py clean_db
   ```

This command will truncate all the tables and remove the data.

## serializers 
1. This projects make use of serializers as it builds rest based backend of gutenberg project. There is book serializer, which converts all of its fields to json representation including many to many fields, I am using SerializerMethod field that uses class method to get all the author names and other many to many field and convert them to json format. 
2. There is no particular validation is required in this use case. 
3. For ordering fields correctly, meta class fields attribute is set properly. 
4. There are other serializers present in the file that can be used if instead of just object present string (author name, format url, etc.) we want to completely serializer the related object and use the nested serializer for presentation. 
5. tests for serializers will be added in tests directory, as of now there no particularly complicated calulations are happening to include in tests. 

## Filters 
1. We can filter books by multiple gutenberg_ids separated by comma and book objects will be returned if they match any value of the search filter. for example id=1,2,3 
2. we can filter books by multiple languages separated by comma, if book matches any language code it will be returned in the filtered objects. for example language=en,fr
3. We can filter books by multiple Mime type, if book matches any mime type it will be part of filtered query set. 
4. We can filter using multiple, partial and case insensitive author name. Lets say we have author John in the queryset, its book will be returned if we filter books with any criteria like jo, hn or such. Like this we can include multiple values in the filter criteria. 
5. We can filter using multiple, partial and case insensitive title of books. 
6. We can filter using mulitple topics. If topic of book includes substring of search criteria partially and case insensitively it will be part of filtered queryset. Set of topic includes all book shelf names and subject names of the books.   

## Views 
1. In response of API Call, we are passing list of books in response that contains book object with following fields: 
    - title of book 
    - information about author list  
    - language code list 
    - subject name list  
    - bookshelf name list 
    - list of links to download in different formats (MIME Types) 
2. If books are more than 20, in that case 20 book objects will be returned per page. Rest frameworks pagination class is being used for this. 
3. Books are ordered from highest number of downloads to lowest. 
4. Data is returned in JSON Format. 
5. Views also include filter class to filter books according to filter criteria as described above. 

## Test Coverage 
1. Test directory in main app contains all the test cases for following modules. 
    - apis 
    - filters 
    - models 
    - serializers 
    - urls 
2. Tests for apis tests that if apis are giving expected response. 
3. Tests for filters tests if filter classes are working in expected manner, it creates test db and insert some objects in it and runs filter on them and checks if filtered data is correct. 
4. Tests for models checks if we are able to create and delete objects successfully. And also checks if many to many fields and reverse relationship of many to many fields are working correctly. 
5. Currently there are no tests for serializers. 
6. Tests for urls checks if view name is resolved to correct url. 
7. Github action script is added for continuous integration pipeline that runs these tests for every push and pull request. 

## Query Optimization and Performance 
1. This project does not make use of any heavy queries other than for fetch complete queryset of books from database, it uses prefetch over that to fetch many to many fields so that we dont have to fetch them again while serializing related objects. 
2. Django Debug toolbar is used to see how many queries are being made for processing particular view.
