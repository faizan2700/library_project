# Gutenberg Database Clone

Welcome to the Gutenberg Database Clone project! ðŸ“š

This project aims to create a clone of the Gutenberg project by utilizing their database dump. Gutenberg, named after the famous inventor of the printing press, is a digital library offering over 60,000 free eBooks, covering a wide range of genres and subjects. By cloning their database, we aim to provide developers and enthusiasts with a locally accessible version of the Gutenberg project for experimentation, analysis, and integration into their own projects.

## Features

- **Database Clone**: Utilize the Gutenberg project's database dump to recreate a local version of their digital library.
- **Offline Access**: Access the vast collection of over 60,000 free eBooks offline for research, analysis, or reading pleasure.
- **Exploration and Analysis**: Analyze the Gutenberg dataset to gain insights into literary trends, popular genres, and authorship.
- **Integration**: Integrate the cloned Gutenberg database into your own applications, projects, or research endeavors.
- **Contributions**: Contribute to the project by enhancing the database clone, improving accessibility, or adding new features.

## Database Model

This project utilizes the Gutenberg database dump, consisting of the following tables:

- **Author**: Contains information about authors of the eBooks.
- **Language**: Stores information about the languages in which the eBooks are available.
- **Bookshelf**: Represents bookshelves containing collections of eBooks.
- **Subject**: Stores subjects or categories of eBooks.
- **Format**: Contains links and media types for each eBook.
- **Book**: Represents individual eBooks and includes Many-to-Many relationships with authors, subjects, bookshelves, and languages.

Additionally, the project utilizes the Django `User` model, which utilizes an abstract table from the Django contrib auth app.

## Getting Started

To prepare the database for use, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the following commands, This will populate all the necessary tables with data.:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py populate_db  
   ```
3. To clean the database, run: 
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py clean_db
   ```
python3 manage.py clean_db

This command will truncate all the tables and remove the data.
